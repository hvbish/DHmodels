Initial Setup of C Compilers on Local Machine
---------------------------------------------

- To check which compilers you have, type "g++" on the command line and tab to complete
- If needed, 'brew install gcc'
- Edit Makefile and set CXX equal to the name of the compiler (e.g., 'CXX = g++-11)
- Enter 'make' on the command line. This will generate some new files including the C library file libobj.so*
